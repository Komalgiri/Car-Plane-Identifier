This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates image classification using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented with Keras. The CNN is trained on a dataset of images containing two classes: "cars" and "planes". The model is then used to make predictions on new images.

## Requirements

To run this code, you need the following dependencies:

- Python (version 3.x)
- Keras library
- NumPy library

You can install the required libraries using `pip` with the following command:

	```bash
		pip install keras numpy
	```

## Code Description

- `train.py`: This Python script defines the CNN model architecture and trains it using a dataset of images containing "cars" and "planes". The trained model is saved for future use.

- `predict.py`: This Python script loads the pre-trained model and uses it to make predictions on new images.

- `v_data` directory: This directory contains the training and testing images for the "cars" and "planes" classes.

## How to Use

1. Download or clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Make sure you have Python (version 3.x) and the required libraries installed.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the code is located.

4. To train the model, run the following command:

   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

   The script will train the CNN on the training dataset, display the model summary, and save the trained model as `model.h5`.

5. To make predictions on new images, place your test images in the `v_data/test/cars` or `v_data/test/planes` directory. Then, run the following command:

   ```bash
   python predict.py
   ```

   The script will load the pre-trained model from `model.h5`, make predictions on the test images, and display the results.

## Customization

- To use your own dataset, replace the images in the `v_data/train/cars`, `v_data/train/planes`, `v_data/test/cars`, and `v_data/test/planes` directories with your dataset images. Make sure to organize them into the appropriate subdirectories.

- If you wish to modify the model architecture or training parameters, you can edit the `train.py` file. You can experiment with different CNN architectures and hyperparameters to improve the model's performance.

## Important Notes

- The current implementation uses a small dataset for demonstration purposes. For real-world applications, a larger and more diverse dataset is recommended to achieve better results.

- The provided code is a simple example of image classification using CNNs. For more complex tasks or larger datasets, consider using pre-trained models and transfer learning techniques.
